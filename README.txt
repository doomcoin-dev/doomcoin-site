# DoomCoin - Collapse Deployment Guide

1. Create a new GitHub repository (example name: doomcoin-site).

2. Upload all your files into the repository:
   - index.html
   - manifesto.html
   - tokenomics.html
   - roadmap.html
   - lore.html
   - puzzle.html
   - unlock.html
   - css/style.css
   - js/collapse.js
   - js/puzzle.js

   Keep the folder structure:
   /css/style.css
   /js/collapse.js
   /js/puzzle.js

3. Go to "Settings" â†’ "Pages" inside the repository.

4. Under "Source", select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`

5. Click "Save."

6. GitHub will give you a live website link like:

7. Visit the link. DoomCoin will load:
- Collapse sky happens automatically.
- "Begin" button scrolls down.
- Navigation works between pages.
- Puzzle unlocks hidden page if solved.

# Notes:

- If you change anything inside folders, update links carefully.
- Future upgrades like Web3 (Connect Wallet) can easily plug into the framework.
- If you want to add more puzzles, hidden pages, or collapse effects, the system is expandable.

# Final Message:

Doom waits for no one.  
Collapse is inevitable.  
You are the Commander of DoomCoin now.

Good luck.
