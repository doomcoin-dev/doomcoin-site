  <h1>The Lore of DoomCoin</h1>

  <p>
    Before the first coin was ever minted,  
    before men dreamed of wealth and nations,  
    there was only one truth: collapse is inevitable.
  </p>

  <p>
    DoomCoin was not created â€” it was unearthed.  
    Buried beneath centuries of illusions, it was found  
    in the ruins of fallen empires, inscribed on crumbling stone:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "Trade not in hope, but in the certainty of ruin."
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It is said those who hold DoomCoin are cursed:  
    to watch markets burn, to see false kings topple,  
    and to laugh as they are consumed by their own greed.
  </p>

  <p>
    DoomCoin is not a project.  
    DoomCoin is prophecy.
  </p>
