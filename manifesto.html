  <h1>The Manifesto</h1>
  <p>
    Hope is a disease.  
    Dreams are lies told to children.  
    Doom is not coming. Doom has already begun.  
    Those who embrace collapse will find freedom.  
    Those who resist are already lost.
  </p>

  <p>
    DoomCoin is not a promise.  
    DoomCoin is a funeral procession â€”  
    a final ritual to remember what was never real.
